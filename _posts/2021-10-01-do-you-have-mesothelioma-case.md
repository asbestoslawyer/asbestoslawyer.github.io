title: Do You Have a Mesothelioma Case?
---
Mesothelioma This post does not constitute legal advice, nor does it create any kind of client/attorney relationship. If you would like for your case to be reviewed by a licensed mesothelioma attorney, get a free legal evaluation.

Since asbestos exposure was determined to cause cancer, a number of law firms, advertisements and awareness campaigns have popped up, informing mesothelioma sufferers of their right to restitution. Talking to a lawyer can be a good first step to determining if you have a case worthy of a lawsuit, though there are several factors you can evaluate on your own to help you make this decision.

Where were you exposed?
The first step is to determine where you experienced asbestos exposure. If you came into contact with asbestos on the job, and this hazard wasn’t properly revealed to you, it’s possibly that you have a suit to bring against a former or current employer. People that have worked in certain industries are more likely to have been exposed to asbestos. For example if you worked as a shipbuilder, construction worker or electrician in the past, you may have been exposed to asbestos without your knowledge.

When did symptoms occur?
Keep in mind that symptoms of mesothelioma often do not occur until 20-30 years after the repeated asbestos exposure, so you may need to trace your employment history back quite a ways to determine were you may have first come into contact with the substance. Thirty years ago, not as much was known about asbestos as is known today, so it’s possible that if you were exposed during this time, you weren’t properly informed.

Were you serving in the military?
If you were exposed to asbestos while on the job serving in the armed forces, you may face a fight, as the Veteran’s Health Administration does not recognize mesothelioma as a a “service-related illness.”

In this case, or in any of the cases mentioned above, it’s always a good step to seek the advice of an attorney. If you need to file a lawsuit, they will be best suited to help get the ball rolling.
